## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Always use the latest version of CyborgAI CLI
- Keep Rust and dependencies updated
- Use official installation methods only
- Verify checksums when downloading releases
- Report suspicious behavior immediately

### For Contributors

- Follow secure coding practices
- Use `cargo audit` to check for vulnerable dependencies
- Implement proper input validation
- Use safe Rust practices (avoid `unsafe` blocks unless necessary)
- Handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information
- Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities

## 🔐 Security Features

CyborgAI CLI implements several security measures:

### Current Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Safe Dependencies**: Regular dependency audits using `cargo audit`
- **Memory Safety**: Leverages Rust's memory safety guarantees
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- **File System Access**: Controlled file system access with proper permissions

### Planned Security Enhancements

- **Sandboxing**: Process isolation for enhanced security
- **Encryption**: Encrypted storage for sensitive data
- **Authentication**: User authentication and authorization
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Code Signing**: Signed releases for integrity verification

## 🔍 Security Audits

### Dependency Audits

We regularly audit our dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Run security audit
cargo audit

# Update dependencies
cargo update

# Check for outdated dependencies
cargo outdated
```

### Code Reviews

All code changes undergo security-focused code reviews:

- Input validation checks
- Memory safety verification
- Dependency security assessment
- Error handling review
- Authentication/authorization verification
